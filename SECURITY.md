## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Claude Code Bot, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

**üö´ DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@claude-code-bot.dev` (if available)
2. **GitHub Private Reporting**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: For highly sensitive issues, request our PGP key

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Classification (e.g., injection, authentication bypass)
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are affected
- **Attack Scenario**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage and affected users
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or demo (if applicable)
- **Suggested Remediation**: If you have ideas for fixes

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports quickly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Confirmation**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 5 business days until resolved
- **Fix Release**: Target 14 days for critical, 30 days for high severity
